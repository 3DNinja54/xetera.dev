A month or two ago, I put an image of a tierlist of languages that I like using in my Github readme, ranked from F to S tier. F being my least favorite, and S being my favorite. It looked something like this:

![language preference chart](./language-preference.png)

- **(S)** Rust, Haskell
- **(A)** Kotlin, Elixir, F#
- **(B)** Scala, Typescript, Dart, C#
- **(C)** Java, Ocaml, Python, Javascript, C++, Ruby
- **(D)** PHP, Coffeescript, Powershell, Lua, Clojure
- **(F)** Go

<br />

I had opinions on a few more languages, but the tierlist I was using didn't have them. Maybe I'll make my own website for ranking programming languages at some point.

export const Rustacean = () => (
  <Toastable text="Rustaceans" color="orange.300">
    Name given to the people in the Rust community
  </Toastable>
)

export const Gopher = () => (
  <Toastable text="Gophers" color="blue.300">
    Name given to the people in the Go community
  </Toastable>
)

A bunch of people were upset over how I placed their favorite languages in the C tier. <Gopher />, however, were <T>FURIOUS</T> that their favorite language was the only one at F tier.

What do I have against Go? Before I get into Go, let me explain to you why the S tier looks the way it does and what I'm looking to see.

## Correctness

I don't know about everyone else, but I am a pretty bad programmer. I often make silly mistakes in my code or skip important things in code review that I should be catching. I'm confident in my skills but if you put in me
