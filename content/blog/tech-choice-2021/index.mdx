A few days ago, I put an image in my Github readme file of a tierlist of languages that I like using, ranked from F to S tier. F being my least favorite, and S being my favorite.

![language preference chart](./language-preference.png)

- **(S)** Rust, Haskell
- **(A)** Kotlin, Elixir, F#
- **(B)** Scala, Typescript, Dart, C#
- **(C)** Java, Ocaml, Python, Javascript, C++, Ruby
- **(D)** PHP, Coffeescript, Powershell, Lua, Clojure
- **(F)** Go

I had opinions on a few more languages but the tierlist I was using didn't have them. Maybe I'll make my own website for ranking programming languages sometime.

export const Rustacean = () => (
  <Toastable text="Rustaceans" color="orange.300">
    Name given to the people in the Rust community
  </Toastable>
)

export const Gopher = () => (
  <Toastable text="Gophers" color="blue.300">
    Name given to the people in the Go community
  </Toastable>
)

A bunch of people didn't really like how I put their favorite languages in C tier. <Rustacean /> were just like "yeah that sounds about right" when they saw Rust at S tier, and <Gopher /> were <T>FURIOUS</T> over seeing their favorite language at the bottom.

I hold two, oddly contradicting views when it comes to programming. For one, I believe
