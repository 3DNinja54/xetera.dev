I've noticed a lot of people are confused about this idea. Truthiness makes some level of intuitive sense.

```js
if ("") {
  console.log("Never runs")
}
```

import Xetera from "@assets/avatars/xetera.png"
import TzuyuImage from "@assets/avatars/tzuyu.png"

import YooYikes from "@assets/emotes/yooyikes.png"

export const Me = props => (
  <DiscordMessage
    username="Xetera"
    roleColor="pink.300"
    avatar={Xetera}
    {...props}
  />
)

export const Tzuyu = props => (
  <DiscordMessage
    username="Tzuyu"
    roleColor="blue.400"
    avatar={TzuyuImage}
    {...props}
  />
)

  <Tzuyu

      "Yeah",
      "I think so",
      "like if you were comparing 'test' == true it would be truthy",
    ]}
