There's a quote that every breathing human ever has either heard of before or recited for themselves that goes:

> Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.

And while I agree with the premise, I think this is a pretty outdated saying, and I'd like to propose a third alternative that is inspired by the words of the famous philosopher Ron Swanson.

Don't teach a man to fish. He's a grown man; he can learn to fish on his own. Instead, show him why he would want to do that in the first place. Show him why you're passionate about fishing. Take him out for a boat ride, and get him excited about how good it feels when you catch something after patiently waiting for hours. Describe to him the details of fishing that make it feel so rewarding to sit with a pole in your hand for a whole day. But _please_, for the love of God, don't teach him how to fish. He doesn't need you for that.

Admittedly, this version doesn't quite roll off the tongue, so I'm probably not going to be remembered for it when I die, but I still think it touches on a topic I believe is important.

## Why we learn

For a very long time, teaching was something we had to do out of necessity. If you wanted to survive, you had to learn how to hunt, how to avoid predators, how to gather supplies for your tribe. Later on, this transitioned into things like farming and trade. And as of fairly recently, during the time of the industrial revolution, we learned to channel this instinct into institutions capable of growing a large population of little people into skilled factory workers years down the line.

Sure, even in the early days, we were concerned with arts and other non-essential skills that were passed down from generation to generation, but they were not much more than side projects. Something you did when you were free from the work someone forced you into doing. If little Ugubwe wanted to eat that night, he had to hunt with the men of the tribe, and then he could paint on the cave walls later if he wanted to.

This way of learning worked well for its intended purpose for many `thousands` of years, but because it was motivated by necessity, you were never asked about what it was that you wanted to learn. You were either given a task you had to do for a lifetime or had to find out what that was if you wanted to survive. Contrast that to how things are today; a lot has changed.

)

As our global economies are transitioning out of the <SecondarySector /> and into the <TertiarySector />, we're finding that there is objectively more work to be done compared to what our parents and grandparents had to do. Statistically speaking, if you're in middle school today, by the time you're ready to join the workforce, you're most likely going to be working a job that doesn't even exist yet. When it comes to career choice, we can now choose from a plethora of options, and we live in an era where all the information we need to do and learn new things is at our fingertips. Yet, for some reason, the fisherman is `still` trying to teach us to fish.

## What if I don't want to become a fisherman?

> So Jakey, what do you want to be when you grow up?

Every kid's one dreaded question. Of the million things you could choose as a profession, chances are you have no idea what I could be interested in growing up. We force kids to learn a common core curriculum and expect them to magically have an idea of what they could be doing for a living after high school or college.

When we were still hunter and gatherers, at least after you learned to hunt, you had all the skills necessary to become a hunter. How does this translate to school now? Do all kids want to become English teachers and biologists? Oh, I'm sorry, were you sleeping in your `investment banking` class? Maybe you should pay more attention in your `marketing` class next time because not only do you not have any of the skills necessary to work in marketing -- you don't even know what that means as a career.

The bottom line is that school does **absolutely nothing** to teach you about different fields you could be interested in. You will learn the things some boomers decided you should know many years ago with a few revisions here and there, and you will be released into the wild with no valuable knowledge to further your career or your desire to learn.

I don't mean valuable knowledge in the way an annoying middle-schooler would talk about it in science class going:

I mean the kind of information **YOU** consider to be interesting is what is valuable to you. I need more than just to be able to feed myself. I need self-actual
