Every once in a while someone pops into one of the programming communities I'm active in and comes in asking for someone else to do their homework because they can't finish the assignment they're working on themselves. They inform everyone that they have a deadline they can't meet and that they don't even know where to start. If this is you, this is not an article aimed at you. If you feel like you enjoy programming or you're interested in pursuing it as a career and run into roadblocks along the way getting work done for school, should probably stay in school and try to learn more on your own to catch up. Programming is difficult.

Slightly less frequently, I see complaints by some developers that go along the lines of

> I have to do this dumb assignment for school I know how to do but don't want to spend time doing it because it's a waste of time.

or sometimes the more common

> I already know what I'm doing and this stuff is just stupid and I hate school making me do things I shouldn't have to do.

and a real life example that goes

Complaining about the things that school forces you to make you do in a prime time period where you could be focusing on becoming a better programmer and/or computer scientist. If this is you, I have one question for you.

# Why don't you just drop out dude?

This is one of those ideas that slowly creeps up on you and never really takes you by surprise at any given point. Going through the moutains of dumb stuff that you have to do for school, eventually you begin to wonder "What am I even doing here".
