Chances are, if you use <T>The Internet</T> today, you probably feel that --aside from a few malicious hackers-- the web is made up primarily of humans. And while you wouldn't be blamed for thinking that, there's actually a whole world of automation out there you probably don't notice.

There are different kinds of bots whos tasks range from crawling the internet to make websites accessible for everyone, to making businesses lose as much money as possible. The story of bots on the internet is one made up of protagonists, antagonists and countless supporting characters. Villains who try to pillage cities for gold and unwanted heroes who put everyone else at risk in order to save the day.

import { RiExternalLinkLine } from "react-icons/ri"

<Link

  <Heading mb={6} fontSize={["xl", "2xl", null, "3xl"]}>
    62% of all web traffic comes from bots
    <RiExternalLinkLine
      style={{ marginLeft: "5px", display: "inline", verticalAlign: "top" }}
      size={28}
    />
  </Heading>
</Link>

That's a pretty scary-sounding headline. But what does the term "bots" really mean in this case?

`Bots` on the internet come in many different shapes and sizes. Some are good, some are purely nefarious and a lot of the other ones sit on a spectrum in between. It's hard to look at a headline like this alone and figure out whether or not that's a bad thing.

import { Text, Heading, Flex } from "@chakra-ui/layout"

export const Botanists = () => (
  <Toastable text="botanists" color="green.300">
    <Flex flexDirection="column">
      <Flex alignItems="baseline">
        <Heading mr={2} fontSize="md">
          Botany
        </Heading>
        <Flex
          layerStyle="borderSubtlePrimary"
          borderWidth="1px"
          borderRadius="md"

)

I will be using an extremely scientifically rigorous model created by the brightest philosophers and <Botanists /> of our generation to explain where I place different aspects of the automation ecosystem in (my) moral system.

### ðŸ˜‡ Lawful Good

The good guys.

Basically any automation that is beneficial to you and conforms to how you expect it to behave with pure intentions. These are generally your standard search engines. They're the reason why the internet works in the first place. Aside from a few ridiculous crawlers like `Baidubot`, they will go out of their way to ensure your site isn't affected by what they're doing.

They're also the reason why it's challenging to protect yourself against unwanted automation. Sometimes a good solution for blocking bad bots you don't want might need to be reconsidered if it prevents the "good" automation in this category.

### ðŸ˜‡ Neutral Good

export const BlueTeam = () => (
  <Toastable color="blue.400" text="blue team">
    Blue team in computer security refers to the party that is on the defending
    side of a system that is being attacked.
  </Toastable>
)

The <BlueTeam />.

These companies will ensure that `Neutral Evil` does not manage to automate your website and cause harm. They fight for good, but the methods that they use to provide their services result in privacy violations for real users through the use of things like browser fingerprinting, and aggressive data collection.

`Neutral Good` is in a constant battle with `Neutral Evil` as well as regular users who feel like they become collateral damage in the name of web security.

### ðŸ˜‡ Chaotic Good

Automation that is ultimately for the benefit of everyone but has to be exercised with caution.

One of the best examples of this is probably <Link href="https://shodan.io">Shodan.io</Link>. They let you stay secure if you use it properly but also allows bad actors to uncover information about your infrastructure that could've
otherwise stayed hidden.

### ðŸ™„ Lawful Neutral

Overall useful utilities with no specific benevolent or malevolent purpose.

IoT devices in specific have no specific alignment other than doing what they need to be doing which is generally positive. They don't provide a service in general that can be considered inherently malicious or benevolent.

### ðŸ™„ True Neutral

Mostly uninvolved 3rd parties.

These people aren't really motivated in any particular way. They just want to go about their day without having to deal with a bunch of stuff. This is usually people who are just trying to create something new for the sake of learning or for fun, and often get caught in the crossfire.

### ðŸ™„ Chaotic Neutral

The people who provide ammunition for everyone else.

`Chaotic Neutral` does not bring harm to any site or individual, instead they customers customers who want to do the dirty work the tools to help them carry out abuse easier. They don't care about what kinds of people they are enabling.

### ðŸ˜ˆ Lawful Evil

I don't actually know what fits into this category.

Any technology or service that is malicious enough to cause problems is motivated by money or something equally as selfish. I can't think of any sort of destructive automation in the wild that claims to be self-righteous to justify its actions. The first thing that comes to mind is something like `Anonymous` but they don't fit into the category of automation.

### ðŸ˜ˆ Neutral Evil

export const RedTeam = () => (
  <Toastable color="red.400" text="red team">
    The red team (in contrast to the blue team) is used to refer to the
    attacking side in computer security.
  </Toastable>
)

The <RedTeam />.

People using automation in this category do not have malicious intentions or want to cause harm to the services they target. However, they believe that they have the right to obtain what they want without any regard for rules and do not care about whether or not their actions will harm the other party involved.

`Neutral Evil` believes that they're not doing anything wrong; instead, they think they're simply hustling and that it's up to everyone else to step up their game instead of being forced to stop.

Despite not being motivated by malice, they're ready to go to similar extents as `Chaotic Evil` to get what they want.

Much like other predators in this category, they thrive when their targets are weak.

### ðŸ˜ˆ Chaotic Evil

The bad guys.

export const Schadenfreude = () => (
  <Toastable text="schadenfreude">
    The joy felt from someone else's misery or pain.
  </Toastable>
)

These are the people who just want to bring chaos and destruction. Whether it's caused by revenge or something else, the automation in this field primarily serves to inflict damage to the victim without benefiting its user (aside from <Schadenfreude />). This mostly includes things like DDoS or destructionware.

Surprisingly, there's not a whole lot that falls into this category. Unlike anime supervillains, most people in real life are not motivated by pure evil; there's almost always an underlying motivation that explains people's actions beyond just being evil and independent.
