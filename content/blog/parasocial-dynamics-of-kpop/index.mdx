      I am very much a kpop fan myself. I have more in common with the people I
      criticize than you might think and that irony is not lost on me. There are
      going to be links throughout the article to kpop songs I like and you
      better listen to them all or I will sue you.

I'm sure you can relate to this scenario if you have a Twitter account. You're sitting on the couch while on your phone, scrolling through the replies on a Twitter thread about politics and you run into one of these.

To be able to truly unpack what's going in this weird dystopian scenario, to delve into the mind of the kpop stan, we have to go back to the very beginning and learn about the steps that fans take that leads to this bizarre situation.

The process that fans go through that ends with wild fanaticism is a very deliberate one made possible by the kpop industry itself. It's similar to the one pre-pubescent girls used to go through during the justin bieber arc of pop music --boy am I glad that's over with-- but you might notice that it's not quite the same. Perhaps it's because social media wasn't as widespread back then, but most people would agree that the online presence of kpop and consequently, its fans are not comparable to that of beliebers or really any modern day fanbase of western pop music. There's something else that's unique to this genre that gets its fanbase so riled up. I'd like to describe it as a 3 step process.

    <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm mb-0">
      The term stan is assumed to originate from Eminem's song{" "}
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOMhN-hfMtY">Stan</a> where one
      of Eminem's fans ends up end up driving himself and his girlfriend off a
      bridge after Eminem's alter-ego doesn't despond to his countless mails.
      <br />
      Why kpop fans use this as an endearing term for themselves I do not know.

# A Normie's Transition into Kpop

For centuries there's been an unchanging formula virtually everyone with a product to sell you has been using. Whether you're trying to hook a user on the story of your game, the events of a movie or the plot of a book, an incredibly powerful tool for achieving this is getting your audience feel personally invested in your product. Games like The Last of Us, for example, do an excellent job at this and as you may imagine the Kpop industry is no stranger to it.

Much like with pop all around the world, you're made aware of the importance the korean music industry places on image, flashy music videos, and really **really** cute girls very early on in your journey into <Hallyu />. But unlike western pop, there's a lot of importance placed on interactions between idols and fans through not only IRL events like concerts and fansigns, but also through different kinds of media like reality tv such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBdQnhwO4gQ">Blackpink House</a> or LOONA TV, going on game shows and interacting directly through apps dedicated to connecting fans and artists like VLive and Weverse. Many groups also "humanize" their fanbases by giving fans a unique name such as "Army" used to refer to BTS fans. This is a crucial part of the strong draw that kpop has as it reminds fans that even though idols might seem to be gods to them in their beauty, skill and intelligence, there's a distinctly human part to them that make it much easier for fans to form bonds with members as a community. Even if that bond is strictly one sided.

> Fans often focus on moments of idols that feel more relatable.

# Conversion

  <Toastable text="hallyu" className="text-indigo-400">
    Literally "korean wave", the umbrella term used to describe the recent
    Korean cultural imperialism that started in the 90's which consists of
    korean pop, TV dramas, food, language and more.
  </Toastable>
)

Despite having a global reach, kpop as a genre also seems to be effective at speaking to lonely, depressed or otherwise unhappy group of people. Its undeniably upbeat melodies, relatable lyrics (if you choose to look up the translations lol) and cute boys and girls are carefully chosen to be appealing to a large audience, one that people going through a rough time seem to be a part of more often than not.

I personally know many people who've felt like they've finally found a community they belong in with kpop, and some who've found a reason to keep living in it. To me this is so important that it almost makes all the other criticisms about the industry as a whole irrelevant. Knowing that, it may be a little bit easier to understand why so many fans around the world feel so emotional when they're confronted with outsiders who brush their favorite idols/groups off or insult the community. Nobody likes to have the people they look up to insulted.

# Community

There's a bit of a paradox with how people perceive the kpop community. Looking in from the outside, theres's no doubt it's extremely toxic given the amount of people who will go to whatever lengths necessary to embarrass themselves. But if you get to actually spend time in any one of them, there's a kind of friendship you form with people over mutual interests that I personally haven't been able to find anywhere else. As amazing as the relationships formed there can be, it's also unfortunately the biggest reason for why many fans feel like they have a personal relationship with the idols they look up to.
