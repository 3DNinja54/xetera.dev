export const Angular = () => (
  <Toastable text="Angular" className="text-red-600">
    Angular is a Javascript framework made by Google. It's not as popular as
    others, but still widely used around the world.
  </Toastable>
)

Ben Awad, a tech youtuber I've been following for a while who also mocks <Angular /> and its users as a running joke on his Youtube channel and Twitter recently released a video explaining how what he's been doing might be harmful after receiving criticism.

<!-- <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark">

    Honestly man, this is not cool. Itâ€™s been kind of depressing to see you bash
    anything that starts with an A. Iâ€™m not the one to tell others about low
    effort posting but this is just tired.

I think this kind of attitude towards jokes is harmful in different ways but before you agree with me, I want to preface this by saying this isn't a political take, I'm not "tired of snowflakes", if you

I have some other stuff here but like I'm pretty shit at writing so yea
