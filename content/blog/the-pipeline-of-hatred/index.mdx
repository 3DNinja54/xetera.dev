I'm someone who's really passionate about social issues. I try to promote and fight for equality as much as possible. You most likely know that about me if you've ever talked to me. If you talked me 7-8 years ago, however, you would remember a very different person. Someone I wouldn't even want to associate with if I had the opportunity to talk to that version of me today.

I want to talk about what got me falling into the pipeline of extremism, why I believed what I did at the time, what helped me get out of it, and how you can help a friend in a similar situation.
