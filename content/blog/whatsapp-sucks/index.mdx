  <h2>Why WhatsApp Only Needs 50 Engineers for Its 900M Users</h2>
</a>

This was one of the headlines that WhatsApp was praised for in 2015, attributing it to their use of Erlang. The engineer inside me still feels giddy at the thought of this since I'm a big fan of functional programming fan myself, but something about this headline doesn't sit right with me anymore. Every time I go to [https://web.whatsapp.com](https://web.whatsapp.com) to check my messages from the last 3 people in my friend circle who still use this app, and I wait for the page to load for 10 minutes only to realize that my phone hasn't been turned on for some time --and that I need to enter my password on my phone to use a chat app on desktop-- I think of this headline and it makes me angrier every time.

The last time I was using this app regularly was around 4 years ago. That was back in the olden times when there were no stickers and ehh... uhm... yeah that's it actually. Everything else was exactly the same. WhatsApp, with their team of the last 50 Erlang developers on Earth, have been busy doing absolutely nothing, at least on the user-facing side.

Within debates I've had with people on this matter, something I've heard come up almost every single time is an argument along the lines of:

export const WaIcon = ({ ...props }) => (
  <img
    src="https://assets.stickpng.com/images/580b57fcd9996e24bc43c543.png"
    {...props}
  />
)

<WideBanner centered style={{ background: "#36393f" }}>
  <div className="mb-2 flex" style={{ color: "#dcddde", lineHeight: "1.4" }}>
    <WaIcon className="mr-3 md:w-10 md:h-10 w-8 h-8" />
    <div>
      <div className="flex items-baseline mb-1">
        <p className="text-pink-700 font-bold" style={{ fontSize: "14px" }}>
          Definitely Not Facebook Employee
          <datetime
            className="text-coolGray-500 ml-2 font-normal"
            style={{ fontSize: "12px" }}
          >
            Today at 5:05 AM
          </datetime>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p style={{ fontSize: "16px" }} className="mb-1">
        Hey man, why does a chat program need features? Isn't it enough for it
        to just allow you to chat with people?
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</WideBanner>

Let's think about this for a second.

## I just send message bro, why feature?

Every time someone says this, WhatsApp product manager just drools all

and it was pretty good at that! But as other apps started gaining popularity, this
fact about WhatsApp has not changed. When Even before being acquired by Facebook,
WhatsApp has been arguably one of the most complacent companies to date.
